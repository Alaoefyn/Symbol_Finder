# Symbol_Finder
Basic code that finds and prints you the desired given as string symbol.

Sometimes we forget about key bindings and research desired math symbols on internet.

Or sometimes we are lazy enough to not remember the keybinds.(Who knows!)

Well,this code is my personal life saver and i am using it instead of remembering keybinding of math symbols.

Enjoy and do not fill your brain useless bindings no more!

If you want to add or develope more options,feel free to participate!

Example Usage:

1-Runned Code (It is working on online IDE's as well)

2-Code asks you--Enter the name of the math symbol:

3-You need to give input of desired math symbol as: Enter the name of the math symbol:integral

4-Code gives you output as your symbol: âˆ«
